Angular Azure Services - Full Stack Demo App

The Angular client part was deployed to Stackblitz with the command 
stackblitz.com/github/TheMulkyWay/Enterprise/tree/master/ClientApp

and can be seen running here

Some features of the app rely on the .NET basesd API's and Database being available.
When these app native API's are not available the parts of the app that use reomote 3rd party API's function as designed.

When the entire stack is deployed to an Azure App Service the latest app native API's, database and seed data along with the client are built.

Typically a code first Entity Framework migrations would need to be run to create the SQL / SQLite database.

## Points
Stackblitz run client, code sourced from github angular repo or client folder of a full stack Web API typically built with Visual Studio IDE and Visual Studio Codes editor.
Typical team size might be from 1 to 5* developers on a client feature basis mapping to a backend microservices driven design.
*Developer numbers vary throughout the developement life-cycle.


The ability to see each incremental change in the development of a feature for an app during the development lifecycle
Each commit easily viewed running as a U.I. reduces time to market.
For a product the end to end user / acceptance testing can be keep up with development versions in scenarios where TDD is not used; the majority of developers

It still is Test Driven Development only its not where you write the test first; which infortunately is the way many developers think of TDD as being.
It's not just writing test code first, its also a process driven by applying tests at every stage, for every new line of code or single character change 
Being able to do this is not what has changed;its how it is done that sites like todays

Tradational FTP'ing to IIS server, now called something like "CDN Blob Storage Static Servers", would that be marketing more than progress?
