Angular Azure Services - Full Stack Demo App

The Angular client part was deployed to Stackblitx with the command 
stackblitz.com/github/TheMulkyWay/Enterprise/tree/master/ClientApp

Some features of the app rely on the .NET basesd API's and Database being available.
When these app native API's are not available the parts of the app that use reomote 3rd party API's function as designed.

When the entire stack is deployed to an Azure App Service the latest app native API's, database and seed data along with the client are built.

Typically a code first Entity Framework migrationcans be run
